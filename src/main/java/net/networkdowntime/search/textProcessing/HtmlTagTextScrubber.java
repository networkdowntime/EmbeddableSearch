/**
 * The HtmlTagTextScrubber is a preprocessor that does scrubbing of multi-word input text removing HTML tags prior to splitting 
 * the content and scrubbing the keywords.
 * HTML tags can contain additional fields that would lose context after splitting:
 * 	i.e. <div type="text">Foo<div/>
 *  would evaluate to "Foo"
