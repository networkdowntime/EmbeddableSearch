/**
 * An individual node of a Trie data structure.
 * Nodes that are a word ending are marked by isEnd = true
 * If the node is the end of a complete word, it is marked by isFullWordEnd = true
 * 
 * The addition of marking full word ends is necessary to support the remove operation on a full trie.
