/**
 * A suffix trie is a data structure that starting with the last letter of a word and iterates forward through all of the 
 * characters building a tree structure. When another word is added it either builds another tree in the data structure, if 
 * the beginning of the word does not already exist, or extends a existing tree with the characters at the ending of the 
 * word that are different than the already indexed words.  This is recursively done for all suffixes of the word to be added
 * by stripping the first character from the end and re-adding the new word.  The non-full suffix trie can tell you the 
 * endings of all of the words with a specific beginning while the full prefix trie can tell you all of the endings for any 
 * substrings of the word.
 * 
 * One of the downsides to a trie is memory usage in a performant implementation.  Several attempts were made to improve the memory usage of this class.
 * 	Switching out from the common hashmap implementation to the trove data structures.
 * 	Experimenting with the initial size and load factor of the hashmaps.
 * 	Creating the children hashmap on demand.
 * 	One potential improvement that I haven't tested yet is converting the methods to static to reduce the per Object memory footprint.
 * 
 * Full Suffix Tree vs Not: I characterize a full suffix tree to include not just the word, but also every suffix of the 
 * word. The non-full suffix tree does not recursively index all of the words prefixes.  
 * 
 * Example full suffix tree for "foo":
 *	Root Node: 2 children [o, f]
 *		Child Node: o: 1 children [o, ï¿¿]
 *		Child Node: f: 1 children [o]
 *			Child Node: o: 1 children [o]
 * 
 * Example non-full suffix tree for "foo":
 *	Root Node: 1 children [f]
 *		Child Node: f: 1 children [o]
 *			Child Node: o: 1 children [o]
 *  
 * Using this implementation I was able to successfully implement a full prefix trie across a sample 843,888 word data set.
