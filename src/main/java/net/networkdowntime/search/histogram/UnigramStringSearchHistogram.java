/**
 * The search histogram tracks the association between a key word, it's search results,
 * and the occurrence count/weight of the result.
 * 
 * This implementation stores the hashcode of the word and a count based on how
 * many times it has been added/removed. Methods are static to reduce the memory
 * footprint of the class.
 * 
 * So there are two different key data structures in the Search Histogram. 
 * 	1. Single Result Map - This is an optimization to reduce overhead for sparsely used
 * 		words that are indexed. Basically, if a word only matches one result then it
 * 		only incurs the penalty of an extra int and long value being stored. Words
 * 		that show up in this data structure have an implied count of 1.
 * 	2. Multi-Result Map - Words that have multiple search results get stored here.
 * 		This applies to counts of 2 for the same word or matches more than one search
 * 		result.  The key is the word's hashcode and the value is a histogram hashmap
 * 		containing the search result and it's histogram count.
