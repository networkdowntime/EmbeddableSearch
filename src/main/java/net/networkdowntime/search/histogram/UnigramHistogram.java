/**
 * Single word/string histogram.
 * 
 * This implementation stores the hashcode of the word and a count based on how many times it has been added/removed.
 * Methods are static to reduce the memory footprint of the class.  The rational behind this is to keep the unigram histogram
 * suitable for embedding within say a 2-gram histogram.
